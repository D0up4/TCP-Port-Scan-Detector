## 📘 Description

This project is a lightweight TCP port scan detector built with Python and Scapy. It captures live TCP traffic on a network interface and analyzes SYN packets to identify potential port scanning or brute-force activity based on the frequency of connection attempts to different ports.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Captures live TCP packets using Scapy
- ✅ Detects suspicious SYN packet bursts indicating possible port scans or brute-force attacks
- ✅ Configurable thresholds for detection sensitivity (number of attempts and time window)
- ✅ Simple console output alerts when suspicious activity is detected
- ✅ Pure Python implementation with minimal dependencies

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script with administrative privileges to allow packet capturing:

```bash
sudo python port_scan_detector.py
